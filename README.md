# Node_JS_Maximillian
this repository is created by adnan which contains detailed explaination while adnan was learning node js from one of the best teachers of udemy the one and only Maximillian Schwarczmuller.

I had done node js before but this time I am doing it to revise my node concepts and also to grasp some new modules into node.

# @The journey begins

who so ever wants to learn from this repo or wants to contribute :
1. each and every module is divided into separate directories for better reach to each module.
2. like this readme every directory has its own readme file .
3. each readme file consists all the key concepts and the code snippet in form of notes 
4. I am using the readme for each section as a note to that section.

```diff

- I had skipped the below modules
- 1. section 1 : introduction (cause it contains just walk through for the whole course)
- 2. Section 2 : Optional : Javascript - A quick refresher

- you can watch it if you are a beginer or just watch a youtube video of harshit vashisth // or // akshay saini
